# Cauchy-s-Stress-Principle-and-Equilibrium-Equations

This repository contains the LaTeX source and compiled PDF for the article:

Cauchyâ€™s Stress Principle is a cornerstone of continuum mechanics, stating that the stress state at a point can be fully described by a second-order tensor. This article defines the principle, derives the static equilibrium equations, and explains their physical meaning with examples. It also highlights applications in structural mechanics and finite element analysis.
